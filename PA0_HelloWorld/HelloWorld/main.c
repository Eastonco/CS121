   Description: This program displays the message "Hello
                CptS 121!" to the screen. Note:
				we can place any English text we want to in
				comment blocks. Comments should help with
				the readability of a program!
*/

// A similar comment block to the one above, should be in every
// C program that you write! We can also use slash-slash for
// one line comments!!!


#include <stdio.h> // need to use printf ()

int main(void) // main () is the starting point of execution for all C programs!
{
	// printf () is used to display information to the screen!
	// If we need to solve the task "display to screen" think
	// about using printf ()!
	printf("Hello CptS 121!\n"); 

	return 0; // indicates success
} // end of main ()
